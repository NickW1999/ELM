# ELM
This script contains a function for an extreme learning machine.
It is based on the paper by Huang and Siew (2004) and the script is based on Gara (2020).
The following features are added to Gara's script: 
*Activation functions ((leaky)ReLu, sine and sigmoid)
*bootstrap
The data is from a paper by Killian (2019) and can be downloaded at the link below.
Further information can be found in the pdf of my thesis.
